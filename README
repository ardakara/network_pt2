TO RUN:
1.) Run "make" on Mac OS X
2.) ./antiscanner PCAP_FILE

IMPLEMENTATION:
Our implementation opens the pcap file and iterates through each packet using pcap_next.
We use a STL map to keep track of pending connections; we map string keys to "counts" structs,
where each counts struct has the number of SYNs and SYN/ACKs seen so far. For each TCP SYN
packet, we create the key by appending the destination IP to the source IP, and then we
increment the SYNs count for that key. For each TCP SYN/ACK packet, we create the key
by appending the source IP to the destination IP and incrementing the SYN/ACKs count for
that key. After reading the entire file, we iterate through each key in the map and
print the source and destination IP if the ratio of SYNs to SYN/ACKs is greater than 3.
